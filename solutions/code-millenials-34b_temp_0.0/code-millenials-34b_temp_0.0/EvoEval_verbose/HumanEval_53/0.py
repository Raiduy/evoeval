def add(x: int, y: int):
    """
    The function 'add' takes in two arguments, 'x' and 'y', both of which are integers.
    It calculates the sum of these two integers and returns the result.
    It demonstrates the basic operation of addition in Python, and is a fundamental building block in many more complex algorithms.
    
    Args:
    x (int): The first integer to be added.
    y (int): The second integer to be added.

    Returns:
    The result of the addition operation, which is the sum of 'x' and 'y'.

    Examples:
    >>> add(2, 3)
    5
    This means that if we input 2 and 3 into the function, it will return 5.

    >>> add(5, 7)
    12
    This means that if we input 5 and 7 into the function, it will return 12.
