    """
    Function to determine whether a given string ('text') is a palindrome or not.

    A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward

    This function takes a string as an argument and returns a boolean value. If the 'text' string is a palindrome, the function returns True. If the 'text' string is not a palindrome, the function returns False.

    Parameters:
    text (str): The string to check for palindrome properties. This should be a sequence of characters. It could be a single word, a phrase, or a number as a string.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the 'text' is a palindrome. False otherwise.

    Examples:
    >>> is_palindrome('')
    True
    This is because an empty string is considered a palindrome as there are no characters to compare.

    >>> is_palindrome('aba')
    True
    This is because 'aba' is a palindrome as it reads the same forward and backward.

    >>> is_palindrome('aaaaa')
    True
    This is because 'aaaaa' is a palindrome as all the characters are the same.

    >>> is_palindrome('zbcd')
    False
    This is because 'zbcd' is not a palindrome as it does not read the same forward and backward.
