def eat(number, need, remaining):
    """
    This function represents a hungry rabbit eating carrots. It takes in the number of carrots already eaten,
    the number of additional carrots needed, and the number of carrots remaining. The function returns an array
    with two elements: the total number of carrots eaten and the remaining carrots after eating. If there are not 
    enough remaining carrots to meet the need, the rabbit eats all the remaining carrots, but still requires more.
    
    Example:
    * eat(5, 6, 10) -> [11, 4]
    * eat(4, 8, 9) -> [12, 1]
    * eat(1, 10, 10) -> [11, 0]
    * eat(2, 11, 5) -> [7, 0]
    
    Args:
    @number (int): Number of carrots already eaten by the rabbit (0 <= number <= 1000).
    @need (int): Additional number of carrots needed by the rabbit (0 <= need <= 1000).
    @remaining (int): Number of carrots still available (0 <= remaining <= 1000).
