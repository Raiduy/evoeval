    """
    Given a square grid of N rows and N columns (N >= 2), each cell holds a unique integer value ranging from 1 to N*N inclusive. 
    The task is to determine the minimum path of length k. A path can start from any cell and proceed to any neighboring cell which shares an edge with the current cell. 
    The path should remain within the grid. A path is defined as minimum if the ordered list of cell values it passes through is lexicographically smaller than any other path of length k.
    The function returns an ordered list of cell values the minimum path goes through.

    Examples:

        Input: grid = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]], k = 3
        Output: [1, 2, 1]

        Input: grid = [ [5,9,3], [4,1,6], [7,8,2]], k = 1
        Output: [1]
