def magical_sequence(start, end, divisor):
    """This function takes three positive integers: 'start', 'end', and 'divisor'. It returns a list of all 
    the numbers in the range ['start', 'end'] inclusive, that are divisible by 'divisor' and are prime numbers. 
    If no such number exists, the function should return an empty list.

    For example:
    magical_sequence(10, 20, 2) returns an empty list because there are no prime numbers in the range [10, 20] that are divisible by 2.
    magical_sequence(1, 5, 3) returns [3] because 3 is the only prime number in the range [1, 5] that is divisible by 3.
    magical_sequence(10, 15, 6) returns an empty list because there are no prime numbers in the range [10, 15] that are divisible by 6.
