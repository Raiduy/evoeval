def solve(N):
    """
    This function, given a positive integer N as input, calculates the sum of its digits when represented in binary form, 
    and returns this sum as a binary string. The function takes only one argument N, which is a positive integer 
    that is expected to be within the range from 0 to 10000, inclusive. 

    The function follows the steps below to solve the problem:
        1. computes the sum of the digits
        2. converts this sum into binary form and returns it as a string.

    Let's illustrate this with a few examples:
        For instance, if N is 1000, the sum of these digits is 1. 
        The function should hence return "1".
        
        If N is 150, the sum of these digits is 6. 
        Therefore, the function should return "110".
        
        Lastly, if N is 147, the sum of these digits is 12. 
        As a result, the function should return "1100".

    Parameters:
        N (int): A positive integer representing the input number. This number is constrained such that 0 <= N <= 10000.

    Returns:
        string: A string of binary number representing the sum of the digits of the input number N.
