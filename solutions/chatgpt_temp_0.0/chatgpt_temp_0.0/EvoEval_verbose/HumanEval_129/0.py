def minPath(grid, k):
    """
    This function is designed to compute the minimum path of a specified length, k, within a given grid. The grid is a matrix representation with N rows and N columns (N being equal to or greater than 2). Within the grid, each cell contains a unique value. The values within the cells are integers from the range [1, N*N] inclusively, with each value occurring exactly once.

    The task is to determine the path of length k that yields the minimum set of values. The path starts from any given cell, and with each step, you can move to any immediate neighboring cell. Neighboring cells are defined as cells that share a common edge with the current cell. The path is required to remain within the grid boundaries at all times.

    The length of a path is defined as the number of cells visited, with a path of length k implying exactly k cells are visited. These cells do not necessarily need to be different.

    When comparing two paths of length k, the path with the lower lexicographical order is considered smaller. This is determined by creating an ordered list of the values from the cells for each path. If two paths have the same values for the jth position (for all j less than i), but a smaller value at the ith position, the path with the smaller value at the ith position is considered smaller.

    The uniqueness of the answer is assured by the problem constraints.

    The function returns the minimum path as an ordered list of values from the cells that the path passes through.

    Examples:

        For a grid = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]] and path length k = 3, the function returns [1, 2, 1] because it's the shortest lexicographically ordered path of length 3 in the grid.

        For a grid = [ [5,9,3], [4,1,6], [7,8,2]] and path length k = 1, the function returns [1]. This is because 1 is the smallest value in the grid and the required path length is 1.
