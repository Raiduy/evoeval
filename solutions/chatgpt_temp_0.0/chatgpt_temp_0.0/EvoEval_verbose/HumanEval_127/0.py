def intersection(interval1, interval2):
    """
    The function intersection is intended to determine whether the length of 
    intersection of two given intervals is a prime number. 

    Each interval is a pair of integers in the form of (start, end). For example, 
    an interval could be represented as (1, 2). 

    The given intervals are closed, which means that they include both the 'start' 
    and 'end' values. In other words, the interval (start, end) includes 
    all the numbers between 'start' and 'end', inclusive.

    It is assumed that for each provided interval, the 'start' value is less than 
    or equal to its 'end' value. 

    The function's task is to find the overlapping part, if any, of the two 
    given intervals, and then determine whether the length of this intersection 
    is a prime number. 

    A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive integer 
    divisors other than 1 and itself. The length of intersection is calculated 
    as the difference between the 'end' value and 'start' value of the intersection. 

    If the length of intersection is a prime number, the function returns "YES". 
    If it's not a prime number, or if the two intervals do not intersect, the 
    function returns "NO".

    Examples:
    If the function is called with intervals (1, 2) and (2, 3), it returns "NO" 
    because the intersection is (2, 2) which has a length of 0, and 0 is not prime.
    If the parameters are (-1, 1) and (0, 4), the function returns "NO" because 
    the intersection is (0, 1) which has a length of 1, and 1 is not prime.
    If the function is called with intervals (-3, -1) and (-5, 5), it returns "YES" 
    because the intersection is (-3, -1) which has a length of 2, a prime number.
