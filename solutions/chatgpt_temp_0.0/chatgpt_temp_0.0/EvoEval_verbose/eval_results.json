The length of intersection is calculated \n    as the difference between the 'end' value and 'start' value of the intersection. \n\n    If the length of intersection is a prime number, the function returns \"YES\". \n    If it's not a prime number, or if the two intervals do not intersect, the \n    function returns \"NO\".\n\n    Examples:\n    If the function is called with intervals (1, 2) and (2, 3), it returns \"NO\" \n    because the intersection is (2, 2) which has a length of 0, and 0 is not prime.\n    If the parameters are (-1, 1) and (0, 4), the function returns \"NO\" because \n    the intersection is (0, 1) which has a length of 1, and 1 is not prime.\n    If the function is called with intervals (-3, -1) and (-5, 5), it returns \"YES\" \n    because the intersection is (-3, -1) which has a length of 2, a prime number.\n    \"\"\"\n    (start1, end1) = interval1\n    (start2, end2) = interval2\n    intersection_start = max(start1, start2)\n    intersection_end = min(end1, end2)\n    if intersection_start > intersection_end:\n        return 'NO'\n    intersection_length = intersection_end - intersection_start\n    if intersection_length < 2:\n        return 'NO'\n    for i in range(2, int(intersection_length ** 0.5) + 1):\n        if intersection_length % i == 0:\n            return 'NO'\n    return 'YES'", "base_status": "pass", "plus_status": "pass", "base_fail_tests": [], "plus_fail_tests": []}], "HumanEval/27": [{"task_id": "HumanEval/27", "solution": "\n\n", "base_status": "fail", "plus_status": "fail", "base_fail_tests": [], "plus_fail_tests": []}], "HumanEval/85": [{"task_id": "HumanEval/85", "solution": "\ndef add(lst):\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):\n        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:\n            total += lst[i]\n    return total", "base_status": "pass", "plus_status": "pass", "base_fail_tests": [], "plus_fail_tests": []}], "HumanEval/151": [{"task_id": "HumanEval/151", "solution": "\ndef double_the_difference(lst):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function handles an input list of numbers and operates on the values that are positive odd integers, \n    while it completely ignores negative numbers and non-integer values.

There is no limit to the number of elements within the list, and the list may also contain duplicate string elements. It is important to note that this function is not designed to handle an array of numbers as input. \n\n    The function operates by first identifying and deleting any strings within the 'lst' that have an odd number of characters. This deletion operation is performed in-place on the list. \n\n    Once all strings with odd lengths are deleted, the function then sorts the remaining elements of 'lst'. This sorting is performed in ascending order based on the length of each string. Thus, shorter strings (with fewer characters) will appear earlier in the list while longer strings (with more characters) will appear later in the list.\n\n    In the event that two or more strings have the same length, these strings are sorted alphabetically to determine their order within the list. \n\n    The function then returns the sorted list of strings. \n\n    It should be noted that this function operates under the assumption that all words will have the same length.

It's a straightforward program that hinges on a decision based on whether the number 'n' is a prime number or not.\n    \n    The first parameter, 'n', is an integer that the function will evaluate to determine if it's a prime number. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. \n    \n    The second and third parameters, 'x' and 'y', are also integers. These parameters act as return values based on the primality of the first parameter 'n'. \n    \n    If 'n' is determined to be a prime number, the function will return the value of 'x'. If 'n' is not a prime number, the function will return the value of 'y'.\n    \n    Therefore, in essence, this function uses a simple test of primality to decide which of two given numbers to return.\n\n    Examples:\n    Consider the function call x_or_y(7, 34, 12). Here, since 7 is a prime number, the function will return 34.\n    \n    Now consider the function call x_or_y(15, 8, 5). In this case, since 15 is not a prime number, the function will return 5. \n\n    Hence, the function provides an effective way to return one of two numbers based on the primality of a third number.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def is_prime(n):\n        if n <= 1:\n            return False\n        for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):\n            if n % i == 0:\n                return False\n        return True\n    if is_prime(n):\n        return x\n    else:\n        return y", "base_status": "pass", "plus_status": "pass", "base_fail_tests": [], "plus_fail_tests": []}], "HumanEval/76": [{"task_id": "HumanEval/76", "solution": "\ndef is_simple_power(x, n):\n    if x == 1:\n        return True\n    elif n == 1:\n        return False\n    else:\n        i = 0\n        while n ** i <= x:\n            if n ** i == x:\n                return True\n            i += 1\n        return False", "base_status": "pass", "plus_status": "fail", "base_fail_tests": [], "plus_fail_tests": [[-2, -2]]}], "HumanEval/90": [{"task_id": "HumanEval/90", "solution": "\ndef next_smallest(lst):\n    if len(lst) < 2 or len(set(lst)) == 1:\n        return None\n    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)\n    return sorted_lst[1]", "base_status": "pass", "plus_status": "fail", "base_fail_tests": [], "plus_fail_tests": [[[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3]]]}], "HumanEval/83": [{"task_id": "HumanEval/83", "solution": "\ndef starts_one_ends(n):\n    count = 0\n    if n <= 0:\n        return count\n    for i in range(10 ** (n - 1), 10 ** n):\n        if str(i)[0] == '1' or str(i)[-1] == '1':\n            count += 1\n    return count", "base_status": "pass", "plus_status": "fail", "base_fail_tests": [], "plus_fail_tests": [[10]]}], "HumanEval/103": [{"task_id": "HumanEval/103", "solution": "\ndef rounded_avg(n, m):\n    if n > m:\n        return -1\n    total = 0\n    count = 0\n    for num in range(n, m + 1):\n        total += num\n        count += 1\n    avg = round(total / count)\n    binary = bin(avg)\n    return binary", "base_status": "pass", "plus_status": "pass", "base_fail_tests": [], "plus_fail_tests": []}], "HumanEval/15": [{"task_id": "HumanEval/15", "solution": "\n\ndef string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    This function, string_sequence, takes an integer 'n' as an input and returns a string.\n    \n    The function generates a sequence of integers within the range of 0 to n (inclusive of both). \n    The sequence is then converted to a string format with each number separated by a space.\n    \n    The purpose of this function is to create a string representation of a sequence of numbers, \n    which could be useful in a variety of applications where such formatted numerical data is required.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    n (int): A non-negative integer that defines the upper limit of the sequence. \n    \n    Returns:\n    str: A string representing a sequence of space-separated numbers from 0 to n inclusive.\n    \n    Examples:\n    If the function is called with an argument of 0, it will return a string '0'. \n    >>> string_sequence(0)\n    '0'\n    \n    If the function is called with an argument of 5, it will return a string '0 1 2 3 4 5'. \n    >>> string_sequence(5)\n    '0 1 2 3 4 5'\n    \"\"\"\n    sequence = ' '.join((str(i) for i in range(n + 1)))\n    return sequence", "base_status": "pass", "plus_status": "pass", "base_fail_tests": [], "plus_fail_tests": []}], "HumanEval/25": [{"task_id": "HumanEval/25", "solution": "from typing import List\n\n\ndef factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    This function accepts an integer 'n' as input and returns a list of prime factors.
