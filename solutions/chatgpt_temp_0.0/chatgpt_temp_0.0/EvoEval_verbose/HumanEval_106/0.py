def f(n):
    """
    Implement the function f that accepts a single argument, denoted as 'n'. 

    The function is designed to create a list of size 'n', where each element in the list is determined based on its index 'i'. The index 'i' is 1-indexed, meaning the first element in the list corresponds to i = 1.

    The values in the list are calculated in the following manner:
    - If the index 'i' is an even number, the corresponding list element should be the factorial of 'i'. The factorial of a number is calculated by multiplying all positive integers up to that number (i.e., 1 * 2 * ... * i).
    - If the index 'i' is an odd number, the corresponding list element should be the sum of all numbers from 1 to 'i' inclusive. 

    :param n: An integer that determines the size of the output list.
    :return: A list of size 'n' where each element is either the factorial or the sum of numbers from 1 to 'i' depending on whether 'i' is even or odd, respectively.

    Example:

    If we call the function with the input f(5), the output should be [1, 2, 6, 24, 15]. The values are calculated as follows:
    - i = 1 (odd): The sum of numbers from 1 to 1 is 1.
    - i = 2 (even): The factorial of 2 is 2 (i.e., 1 * 2).
    - i = 3 (odd): The sum of numbers from 1 to 3 is 6 (i.e., 1 + 2 + 3).
    - i = 4 (even): The factorial of 4 is 24 (i.e., 1 * 2 * 3 * 4).
    - i = 5 (odd): The sum of numbers from 1 to 5 is 15 (i.e., 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5).
