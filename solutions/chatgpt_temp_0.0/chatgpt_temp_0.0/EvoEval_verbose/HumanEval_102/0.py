def choose_num(x, y):
    """
    This function, 'choose_num', is designed to handle two positive numerical input parameters, 'x' and 'y'. The purpose of the function is to determine, calculate and return the largest even integer that falls within the inclusive range [x, y].

    In essence, the function will search for the maximum even number that exists between the two input parameters, including the parameters themselves. The search will cover all possible integer values within the range. If the function identifies an even integer that fulfills this condition, it will return that number.

    However, the function has been structured to handle situations where no suitable number can be identified. In cases where no even numbers exist within the range [x, y], or the range itself is invalid (i.e., x > y), the function will return a value of -1. This serves as an indication that the function was unable to find a valid solution to the problem.

    The function operates with the following exemplified behavior:

    If the function's input parameters are (12, 15), the function will return '14', as '14' is the largest even integer within the range [12, 15].

    If the function's input parameters are (13, 12), the function will return '-1', as '13' is greater than '12', making the range [13, 12] invalid.
