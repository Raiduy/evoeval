def sorted_list_sum(lst):
    """
    This function, named 'sorted_list_sum', is designed to manipulate a list of strings that is passed as an input parameter called 'lst'. 

    The 'lst' input is anticipated to be a list that contains only string elements. There is no limit to the number of elements within the list, and the list may also contain duplicate string elements. It is important to note that this function is not designed to handle an array of numbers as input. 

    The function operates by first identifying and deleting any strings within the 'lst' that have an odd number of characters. This deletion operation is performed in-place on the list. 

    Once all strings with odd lengths are deleted, the function then sorts the remaining elements of 'lst'. This sorting is performed in ascending order based on the length of each string. Thus, shorter strings (with fewer characters) will appear earlier in the list while longer strings (with more characters) will appear later in the list.

    In the event that two or more strings have the same length, these strings are sorted alphabetically to determine their order within the list. 

    The function then returns the sorted list of strings. 

    It should be noted that this function operates under the assumption that all words will have the same length. If this is not the case, the behavior of the function may be unpredictable.

    Here are some examples to illustrate the functionality of the function:

    Given the input list ["aa", "a", "aaa"], the function will return the list ["aa"]. This is because "a" and "aaa" have odd lengths and are therefore deleted, leaving only "aa" which is returned in a list.

    Given the input list ["ab", "a", "aaa", "cd"], the function will return the list ["ab", "cd"]. This is because "a" and "aaa" have odd lengths and are therefore deleted. The remaining strings "ab" and "cd" have the same length, so they are sorted alphabetically.
