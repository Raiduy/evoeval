def same_chars(s0: str, s1: str) -> bool:
    """
    This function checks if two strings consist of the same set of characters, regardless of their frequency and order in the string. 

    The function takes two arguments, both of which are strings. It will return a boolean value: True if the two strings share the exact same set of characters, and False otherwise. It is important to note that the function does not consider the frequency or order of characters. Therefore, as long as a character exists in both strings, it is counted as a match.

    Here are some examples to illustrate how this function works:

    >>> same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddeddabc')
    True
    In this example, even though the strings are not identical, they do share the same set of characters, so the function returns True.

    >>> same_chars('abcd', 'dddddddabc')
    True
    Similar to the previous example, these strings share the same characters despite the different order and frequency.

    >>> same_chars('dddddddabc', 'abcd')
    True
    Again, though the frequency and order of characters are different, the set of characters is the same.

    >>> same_chars('eabcd', 'dddddddabc')
    False
    Here, the first string contains 'e', which is not found in the second string. Therefore, the function returns False.

    >>> same_chars('abcd', 'dddddddabce')
    False
    This time, 'e' is present in the second string but not the first, so the function returns False.

    >>> same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddddabc')
    False
    Lastly, the function returns False because 'e' is present in the first string but not the second.
