def closest_integer(value):
    """
    This function is designed to take a single parameter 'value', which is a string representation of a numerical value.
    The function's purpose is to return the nearest integer to the given 'value'. If the 'value' is exactly halfway 
    between two integers, the function will round it away from zero. 

    The function operates by converting the string representation of the number to a float, then using standard rounding 
    rules to identify the nearest integer. If the fractional part of the number is .5, the function will round up if the 
    'value' is positive, or round down if the 'value' is negative, thus rounding away from zero in line with the 
    specification.

    Parameters:
    value (str): A string that represents a number, which can be either an integer or a float.

    Returns:
    int: The integer that is closest to the given 'value'. If the 'value' is exactly halfway between 
    two integers, the function will return the integer that is further from zero.

    Examples:
    >>> closest_integer("10")
    10
    >>> closest_integer("15.3")
    15

    Note:
    Rounding away from zero means that if the given number is exactly halfway between two integers, the function will 
    return the integer that is further from zero. For instance, if the given number is "14.5", the function will return 
    15, and if the number is "-14.5", the function will return -15.
