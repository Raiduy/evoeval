def histogram(test):
    """
    This function, histogram(test), takes as input a string 'test' which is expected to be a sequence of lowercase letters
    separated by spaces. Each letter is considered individually regardless of its position in the sequence.

    The purpose of this function is to return a Python dictionary. Each key in the dictionary is a unique letter from the
    input string and each associated value is the number of times the letter appears in the input string.

    In cases where multiple letters all appear the maximum number of times in the input string, the dictionary will include
    all such letters along with their frequencies. If no letters are repeated more times than others, all letters will be included
    in the dictionary with their corresponding counts.

    For example:
    If the function is called with 'a b c' as argument, it will return {'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'c': 1} since each letter appears once.
    If the function is called with 'a b b a' as argument, it will return {'a': 2, 'b': 2} since both 'a' and 'b' appear twice.
    If the function is called with 'a b c a b' as argument, it will return {'a': 2, 'b': 2} since 'a' and 'b' both appear twice, more than any other letter.
    If the function is called with 'b b b b a' as argument, it will return {'b': 4} since 'b' appears four times, and no other letter appears that many times.
    If the function is called with an empty string as argument, it will return an empty dictionary {} as there are no letters to count.

    This function does not handle uppercase letters, special characters, or numbers, and does not consider whitespace as a character to be counted.
