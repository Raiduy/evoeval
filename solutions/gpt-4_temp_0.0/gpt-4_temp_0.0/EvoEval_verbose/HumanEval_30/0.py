def get_positive(l: list):
    """
    This function, get_positive, takes in one argument 'l' which is expected to be a list of numbers. 
    The function's purpose is to filter out and return only the positive numbers from the input list.
    
    The function iterates through each element in the input list and checks if it is a positive number. 
    If it is, the number is added to the output list. 
    If it is not, the number is skipped. 
    By the end of the function, we have a list of only positive numbers from the input list.
    
    Note that the function considers zero as a non-positive number, and it will be excluded from the output list.
    
    Examples:
    - Calling the function get_positive with an input list of [-1, 2, -4, 5, 6] 
    will return a list of [2, 5, 6] since these are the only positive numbers in the input list.
    - Calling the function get_positive with an input list of [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10] 
    will return a list of [5, 3, 2, 3, 9, 123, 1] as these are the positive numbers from the input list, 
    and the zero is excluded.
