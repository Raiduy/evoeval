    """
    This function, named 'anti_shuffle', accepts a string as its input and produces a new string as the output, 
    where each word in the input string is replaced by a new word that is ordered based on the ascii values of its characters. 
    The order of the characters is ascending, i.e., the characters with lower ascii values appear before the characters 
    with higher ascii values. 

    The function maintains the original order of the words and the blank spaces in the sentence. 
    In other words, the function does not rearrange the words or the blank spaces; it only rearranges the characters within each word.

    For instance, if the input string is 'Hi', the function returns 'Hi' since the characters are already in ascending order based on ascii values.
    If the input string is 'hello', the function returns 'ehllo' when it arranges the characters in ascending order.
    If the input string is 'Hello World!!!', the function returns 'Hello !!!Wdlor'. Here, the characters in the word 'World' are rearranged,
    while the characters in 'Hello' remain the same since they are already in the correct order. 
    
    The function does not consider uppercase and lowercase characters as equal, 
    and it uses their distinct ascii values during the sorting process.

    :param s: A string consisting of one or more words, separated by space.
    :return: A string that replaces each word in the input string with a new word, 
             where the characters are arranged in ascending order based on their ascii values.

    For example:
    anti_shuffle('Hi') returns 'Hi'
    anti_shuffle('hello') returns 'ehllo'
    anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!') returns 'Hello !!!Wdlor'
