def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    """
    This function aims to determine and return the 'strongest' extension from a given list of extensions for a specified class. The class and extensions are identified by their names, represented as strings.

    Parameters:
    class_name (str): A string representing the name of the class for which the extensions need to be evaluated.
    extensions (list): A list of strings where each string represents the name of an extension.

    The 'strength' of an extension is calculated using the number of uppercase and lowercase letters in its name. CAP represents the count of uppercase letters, and SM represents the count of lowercase letters in the name of the extension. The strength of an extension is defined as the difference CAP - SM.

    The function will return a string that concatenates the class name and the name of the strongest extension, separated by a period. 

    If there are two or more extensions with the same strength, the function will prioritize the extension that appears first in the input list.

    For instance, if the class is named "Slices" and the list of extensions includes ['SErviNGSliCes', 'Cheese', 'StuFfed'], the function should return 'Slices.SErviNGSliCes'. Here, 'SErviNGSliCes' is the strongest extension with a strength of -1.

    Example:

    The call Strongest_Extension('my_class', ['AA', 'Be', 'CC']) should return 'my_class.AA' because 'AA' has the highest strength among the given extensions.
