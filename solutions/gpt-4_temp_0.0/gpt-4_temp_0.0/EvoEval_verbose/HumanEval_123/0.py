def get_odd_collatz(n):
    """
    This function, 'get_odd_collatz', is designed to accept a single argument 'n', which is a positive integer. The function's task is to generate a sorted list of odd numbers that are part of the Collatz sequence for the given number 'n'. 

    The Collatz sequence is a sequence of numbers relevant to a conjecture in the field of mathematics. The sequence is generated by the following process: Start with any positive integer 'n'. Then, for each subsequent term, if the previous term is an even number, the next term is one half of the previous term. Conversely, if the previous term is odd, the next term is three times the previous term plus one. Regardless of the starting value of 'n', it is conjectured that the sequence will eventually reach the number 1.

    It is important to note the following:
        1. The Collatz sequence for the number 1 is simply [1]. Therefore, for 'n' equal to 1, the function 'get_odd_collatz' will return [1].
        2. The resultant list that the function returns will be sorted in ascending (increasing) order.

    To illustrate how this function operates, consider the following example:
    If we call 'get_odd_collatz' with 'n' equal to 5 (i.e., get_odd_collatz(5)), the function will return [1, 5]. The reasoning for this is as follows: The Collatz sequence for the number 5 is [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]. Out of these numbers, only 1 and 5 are odd. Therefore, the function will return these odd numbers from the sequence, sorted in ascending order.
