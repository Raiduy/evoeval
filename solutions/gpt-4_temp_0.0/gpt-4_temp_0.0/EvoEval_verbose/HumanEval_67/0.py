def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    """
    This function, fruit_distribution, is designed to calculate the number of a specific type of fruit, in this case mangoes, within a mixed fruit basket. The basket contains three different types of fruits: apples, oranges, and mangoes. 

    The function requires two inputs. The first input, 's', is a string that represents the total number of oranges and apples in the basket. The format of this string should be a combination of two integers and two fruit names (apples and oranges) such as "5 apples and 6 oranges".

    The second input, 'n', is an integer that represents the total number of fruits in the basket. This number includes all types of fruits: apples, oranges, and mangoes.

    The function works by subtracting the number of apples and oranges (extracted from the string 's') from the total number of fruits in the basket (the integer 'n'). The resultant value is the number of mangoes in the basket.

    mangoes = n - (apples + oranges)
