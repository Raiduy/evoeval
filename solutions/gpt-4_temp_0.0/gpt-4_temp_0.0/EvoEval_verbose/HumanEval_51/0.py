def remove_vowels(text):
    """
    The function remove_vowels, as the name suggests, is designed to eliminate all vowel characters from a given text string. 

    This function takes a single argument:
    text (str): This is the input string from which vowels are to be removed.

    The function processes the text to remove any of the following vowel characters: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'. It maintains the other characters as they are including spaces, special characters, and consonants.

    Outputs a new string which excludes all the vowel characters present in the input string.

    Examples:

    >>> remove_vowels('')
    ''
    This is an example where an empty string is passed to the function. Since there are no characters to remove, the function returns the same empty string.

    >>> remove_vowels("abcdef
ghijklm")
    'bcdf
ghjklm'
    Here, the input contains a newline character along with alphabets. The function successfully removes vowels and preserves the newline character.

    >>> remove_vowels('abcdef')
    'bcdf'
    This is a case where the input string contains all first 6 letters of the alphabet. The function successfully removes vowels ('a', 'e') to give the output 'bcdf'.

    >>> remove_vowels('aaaaa')
    ''
    In this case, the input string only comprises of the vowel 'a'. Hence, after the function removes all instances, an empty string is returned.

    >>> remove_vowels('aaBAA')
    'B'
    This case shows that the function works well with mixed-case inputs. The vowels 'a' and 'A' are removed from the input to leave 'B'.

    >>> remove_vowels('zbcd')
    'zbcd'
    In this example, the input string doesn't contain any vowels. Therefore, the function returns the input string as it is.
