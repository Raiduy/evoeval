def digits(n):
    """
    This function, digits, takes a single input, n, which should be a positive integer. The purpose of this function is to calculate 
    and return the total product of all the odd digits that appear in n. It does this by first identifying all the odd digits in the integer,
    and then multiplying them together to calculate their product. 

    Here, an 'odd' digit is defined as any integer that is not evenly divisible by 2. For instance, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 are all considered odd digits.

    If the input integer n consists only of 'even' digits, which are digits that are evenly divisible by 2 (e.g., 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8), then the function returns 0. 
    This is because there are no odd digits in n to multiply together.
