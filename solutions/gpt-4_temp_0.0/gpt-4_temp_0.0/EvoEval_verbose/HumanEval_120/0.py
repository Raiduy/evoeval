    """
    This function, 'maximum', is designed to take two parameters: 'arr', an array consisting of integers, and 'k', a positive integer. The role of this function is to return a sorted list of 'k' length, which includes the maximum 'k' numbers from the array 'arr'.

    Detailed input specifications are as follows:

    'arr': This is an array that comprises of integers. The length of this array can be expected to fall within the range [1, 1000]. Each element within this array will be an integer that falls within the range [-1000, 1000].

    'k': This is a positive integer that represents the length of the sorted list to be returned. It is also the count of maximum numbers to be picked from 'arr'. The value of 'k' will be such that 0 <= k <= len(arr).
