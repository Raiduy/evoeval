def vowels_count(s):
    """
    This function, "vowels_count" requires a string as its input—specifically, it needs to be a word. The purpose of the function is to then analyze the string and return the total number of vowels contained within it. The vowels, in this case, are defined as the letters 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'. 

    There is an exception to note: the letter 'y' also counts as a vowel, but it only does so under specific circumstances. If the 'y' appears at the end of the word provided in the input string, then it will be counted as a vowel by this function. However, if 'y' appears anywhere else in the word—i.e., any position other than the end—it will not be identified as a vowel.

    In summary, this function scans a given word (as a string input), counts the number of vowels contained within that word, and then returns that number. The letter 'y' is included in the count only if it is the last letter of the word.
    
        Example:
    >>> vowels_count("abcde")
    2
    >>> vowels_count("ACEDY")
    3
