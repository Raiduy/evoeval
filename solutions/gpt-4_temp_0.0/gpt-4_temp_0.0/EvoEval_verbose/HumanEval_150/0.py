    """
    This function, x_or_y, is designed to receive three parameters: n, x, and y. It's a straightforward program that hinges on a decision based on whether the number 'n' is a prime number or not.
    
    The first parameter, 'n', is an integer that the function will evaluate to determine if it's a prime number. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. 
    
    The second and third parameters, 'x' and 'y', are also integers. These parameters act as return values based on the primality of the first parameter 'n'. 
    
    If 'n' is determined to be a prime number, the function will return the value of 'x'. If 'n' is not a prime number, the function will return the value of 'y'.
    
    Therefore, in essence, this function uses a simple test of primality to decide which of two given numbers to return.
