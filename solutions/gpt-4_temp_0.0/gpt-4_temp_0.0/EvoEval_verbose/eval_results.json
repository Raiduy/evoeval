As another example, if the input is the decimal number 32, the binary representation for 32 is '100000', and the return of the function will be \"db100000db\".\n\n    Parameters:\n    decimal (int): This is the decimal number that will be converted into binary. \n\n    Returns:\n    str: The return value is a string which represents the binary form of the provided decimal number, enclosed within 'db' at both ends for formatting.\n\n    Examples:\n    decimal_to_binary(15)   # returns \"db1111db\"\n    decimal_to_binary(32)   # returns \"db100000db\"\n    \"\"\"\n    binary = bin(decimal)[2:]\n    return 'db' + binary + 'db'", "base_status": "pass", "plus_status": "pass", "base_fail_tests": [], "plus_fail_tests": []}], "HumanEval/75": [{"task_id": "HumanEval/75", "solution": "\ndef is_multiply_prime(a):\n    \"\"\"\n    Define a function called 'is_multiply_prime' that takes a single integer input 'a'.

When we refer to \"odd elements\", we mean the actual integer value of the element is odd (not divisible by 2). \n    Similarly, when we say \"even positions\", we mean the position/index of the element in the list is even. \n\n    The function does not modify the original list and does not have any side effects. If there are no odd elements in even positions,\n    the function returns 0. The function does not handle empty lists and assumes that the input list is always non-empty.\n\n    Examples:\n    Given the list [5, 8, 7, 1], the function would return 12, because 5 and 7 are odd numbers and they are at positions 0 and 2, \n    which are even.\n\n    Given the list [3, 3, 3, 3, 3], the function would return 9, because the numbers at positions 0, 2, and 4 are all 3, which is \n    odd, and their sum is 9.\n\n    Given the list [30, 13, 24, 321], the function would return 0, because there are no odd numbers at even positions.\n    \"\"\"\n    return sum((lst[i] for i in range(0, len(lst), 2) if lst[i] % 2 != 0))", "base_status": "pass", "plus_status": "pass", "base_fail_tests": [], "plus_fail_tests": []}], "HumanEval/30": [{"task_id": "HumanEval/30", "solution": "\n\ndef get_positive(l: list):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function, get_positive, takes in one argument 'l' which is expected to be a list of numbers. \n    The function's purpose is to filter out and return only the positive numbers from the input list.\n    \n    The function iterates through each element in the input list and checks if it is a positive number. \n    If it is, the number is added to the output list. \n    If it is not, the number is skipped. \n    By the end of the function, we have a list of only positive numbers from the input list.\n    \n    Note that the function considers zero as a non-positive number, and it will be excluded from the output list.\n    \n    Examples:\n    - Calling the function get_positive with an input list of [-1, 2, -4, 5, 6] \n    will return a list of [2, 5, 6] since these are the only positive numbers in the input list.\n    - Calling the function get_positive with an input list of [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10] \n    will return a list of [5, 3, 2, 3, 9, 123, 1] as these are the positive numbers from the input list, \n    and the zero is excluded.\n    \"\"\"\n    return [i for i in l if i > 0]", "base_status": "pass", "plus_status": "pass", "base_fail_tests": [], "plus_fail_tests": []}], "HumanEval/53": [{"task_id": "HumanEval/53", "solution": "\n\ndef add(x: int, y: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    The function 'add' takes in two arguments, 'x' and 'y', both of which are integers.\n    It calculates the sum of these two integers and returns the result.\n    It demonstrates the basic operation of addition in Python, and is a fundamental building block in many more complex algorithms.\n    \n    Args:\n    x (int): The first integer to be added.\n    y (int): The second integer to be added.\n\n    Returns:\n    The result of the addition operation, which is the sum of 'x' and 'y'.\n\n    Examples:\n    >>> add(2, 3)\n    5\n    This means that if we input 2 and 3 into the function, it will return 5.\n\n    >>> add(5, 7)\n    12\n    This means that if we input 5 and 7 into the function, it will return 12.\n    \"\"\"\n    return x + y", "base_status": "pass", "plus_status": "pass", "base_fail_tests": [], "plus_fail_tests": []}], "HumanEval/146": [{"task_id": "HumanEval/146", "solution": "def specialFilter(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function is named 'specialFilter' and it accepts a single input argument 'nums', which is expected to be a list of integers.\n\n    The purpose of this function is to calculate and return a count of the number of elements in the 'nums' list that fulfill both of the following criteria:\n    1.

The length of a string is the number of characters \n    that it contains. This includes spaces, digits, alphabets, and special characters. If the input string is empty, \n    the function will return 0, indicating that there are no characters in the string.\n\n    The input to this function should be a string. The function will raise a TypeError if the provided input is not a string.\n\n    The return value of this function is an integer representing the length of the string.\n\n    Here are some examples to demonstrate how this function works:\n\n    >>> strlen('')\n    This will return 0 because the input string is empty and therefore contains no characters.\n\n    >>> strlen('abc')\n    This will return 3 because the input string 'abc' contains three characters: 'a', 'b', and 'c'.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(string, str):\n        raise TypeError('The input must be a string.')\n    return len(string)", "base_status": "pass", "plus_status": "pass", "base_fail_tests": [], "plus_fail_tests": []}], "HumanEval/103": [{"task_id": "HumanEval/103", "solution": "\ndef rounded_avg(n, m):\n    if n > m:\n        return -1\n    else:\n        avg = round(sum(range(n, m + 1)) / (m - n + 1))\n        return bin(avg)", "base_status": "pass", "plus_status": "pass", "base_fail_tests": [], "plus_fail_tests": []}], "HumanEval/100": [{"task_id": "HumanEval/100", "solution": "\ndef make_a_pile(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function is designed to create a 'pile' based on a positive integer input, 'n'. The pile represents levels of stones.\n    Each level's population of stones is determined by a specific rule based on whether the input integer is odd or even.\n\n    The pile is constructed in the following way: \n    The first level always contains 'n' stones, where 'n' is the positive integer input.\n    For subsequent levels, the number of stones is determined by the following rules:\n        - If 'n' is an odd number, then the number of stones on the next level will be the next odd number after 'n' stones.\n        - If 'n' is an even number, then the number of stones on the next level will be the next even number after 'n' stones.\n\n    The function returns a list where each element represents the number of stones on that level. The index of each element in the list represents the level (i+1).\n    For example, the first element in the list (index 0) represents the number of stones on the first level, the second element (index 1) represents the number of stones on the second level, and so on.\n\n    Parameters:\n    n (int): A positive integer which acts as the base for the pile of stones.\n\n    Returns:\n    List[int]: A list of integers where each element represents the number of stones on a certain level of the pile. The index of each element represents the level (i+1).\n\n    Examples:\n    >>> make_a_pile(3)\n    [3, 5, 7]\n    \"\"\"\n    pile = [n]\n    for i in range(n - 1):\n        if n % 2 == 0:\n            n += 2\n        else:\n            n += 2\n        pile.append(n)\n    return pile", "base_status": "pass", "plus_status": "pass", "base_fail_tests": [], "plus_fail_tests": []}]}}
