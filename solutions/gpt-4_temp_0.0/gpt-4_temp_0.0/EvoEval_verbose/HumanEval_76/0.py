def is_simple_power(x, n):
    """
    This function, 'is_simple_power', aims to determine whether a given number 'x' is a simple power of another number 'n'. 
    It returns a boolean value, i.e., 'True' or 'False' based on the evaluation.
    
    The concept of 'simple power' in this context, is described as follows:
    A number 'x' is considered a simple power of 'n' if there exists an integer 'i' such that n raised to the power of 'i' equals 'x' (n**i = x).
    
    The function takes two arguments:
    1. 'x': The number that is to be evaluated. It is the base in the expression n**i.
    2. 'n': The number which is the potential power of 'x'. It is the exponent in the expression n**i.

    Returns:
    This function returns a boolean value. It will return 'True' if the number 'x' is a simple power of 'n'. Conversely, it will return 'False'.
    
    For example:
    is_simple_power(1, 4) => true
    This is 'True' because 4 raised to the power of 0 is 1.
    
    is_simple_power(2, 2) => true
    This is 'True' because 2 raised to the power of 1 is 2.
    
    is_simple_power(8, 2) => true
    This is 'True' because 2 raised to the power of 3 is 8.
    
    is_simple_power(3, 2) => false
    This is 'False' because there is no integer i such that 2**i equals 3.
    
    is_simple_power(3, 1) => false
    This is 'False' because for n=1, the result is always 1 regardless of the power i, thus it can't equal to 3.
    
    is_simple_power(5, 3) => false
    This is 'False' because there is no integer i such that 3**i equals 5.
