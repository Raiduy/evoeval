    """
    This function, 'sort_even', takes a single input parameter 'l', which is a list of integers.
    
    The function returns a new list 'l'' which is designed to be identical to the input list 'l' at all odd indices.
    This means that all elements present at odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) in the input list 'l' will be found in the 
    same indices in the output list 'l''.
    
    For the even indices (0, 2, 4, ...), the function sorts the values found at these indices in the input list 'l'
    and places these sorted values in the corresponding indices in the output list 'l''.

    Thus, elements at even indices of 'l'' are the sorted version of elements at even indices of 'l', 
    while elements at odd indices remain the same in both 'l' and 'l''.
