def simplify(x, n):
    """
    This function is designed to perform the simplification of an expression that's a multiplication of two fractions. 
    The function takes two arguments, x and n, both of which are string representations of fractions. Each fraction is 
    formatted as "<numerator>/<denominator>", where both the numerator and the denominator are positive whole numbers. 
    The function does not handle cases where the denominator is zero, as this is assumed to be an invalid input.
    
    The simplification process involves multiplying the two fractions and then checking if the result is a whole number. 
    If the result of the multiplication is a whole number, then the function returns True. Otherwise, it will return False. 

    It's crucial to notice that the function doesn't actually perform the multiplication operation on the fractions. 
    Instead, it relies on Python's built-in arithmetic operations to evaluate the expression. So, it will behave according 
    to the rules of arithmetic operations in Python.

    For example, simplify("1/5", "5/1") will return True, because the multiplication of these two fractions results 
    in the whole number 1. On the other hand, simplify("1/6", "2/1") will return False, because the multiplication of 
    these two fractions results in the non-whole number 1/3. Similarly, simplify("7/10", "10/2") = False because the result 
    of the multiplication operation doesn't yield a whole number.
