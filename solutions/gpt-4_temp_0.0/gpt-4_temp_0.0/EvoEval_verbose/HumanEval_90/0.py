def next_smallest(lst):
    """
    This function takes as input a list of integer elements, denoted as 'lst'.
    
    The function is designed to find and return the second smallest element present in the 'lst'. 
    The 'second smallest' means that the returned element is greater than the minimum element of the 'lst' 
    but no other element in the list is smaller than this second smallest element.

    If the list 'lst' is empty or all elements in 'lst' are the same, the function returns None. 
    This is because in such cases, there is no valid 'second smallest' element.

    Below are some examples to illustrate how the function operates:

    Example 1:
    If the function is called as next_smallest([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), the function will return 2. 
    This is because 2 is the second smallest element in the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

    Example 2:
    If the function is called as next_smallest([5, 1, 4, 3, 2]), the function will return 2.
    Even though the elements are not in ascending order, 2 is still the second smallest element in the list.

    Example 3:
    If the function is called as next_smallest([]), the function will return None.
    This is because the input list is empty and therefore there are no elements to consider.

    Example 4:
    If the function is called as next_smallest([1, 1]), the function will return None.
    This is due to the fact that all elements in the list are the same, so there is no 'second smallest' element.

    Note: The function assumes that all elements in the input list 'lst' are integers.
