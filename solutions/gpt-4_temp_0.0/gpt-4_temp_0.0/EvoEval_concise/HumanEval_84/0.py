    Returns the sum of the digits in the binary representation of a positive integer N, as a binary string.

    Example:
        For N = 1000, binary sum of digits is 1, output: "1".
        For N = 150, binary sum of digits is 6, output: "110".
        For N = 147, binary sum of digits is 12, output: "1100".

    Output:
        string representing binary number
