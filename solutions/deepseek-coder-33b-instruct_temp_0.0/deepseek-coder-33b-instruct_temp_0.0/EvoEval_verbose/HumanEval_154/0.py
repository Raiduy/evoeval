def cycpattern_check(a, b):
    """
    Given two strings 'a' and 'b', the function cycpattern_check checks if string 'b' or any of its cyclic permutations is a substring of string 'a'.
    
    A cyclic permutation or rotation of a string is obtained by moving characters from the start of the string to the end, 
    or from the end to the start, while preserving the order of other characters. For instance, 'abc' can be rotated to 'bca' or 'cab'.
    
    The function returns True if 'b' or any of its rotations is a substring of 'a', and False otherwise.
    
    Args:
    a (str): The string in which we are searching for substrings.
    b (str): The string that we are checking if it or its rotations are substrings of 'a'.
    
    Returns:
    bool: True if 'b' or any of its rotations is a substring of 'a', False otherwise.
    
    Examples:
    cycpattern_check("abcd","abd") => False
    The rotations of 'abd' are 'bda' and 'dab'. None of these are substrings of 'abcd'.
    
    cycpattern_check("hello","ell") => True
    'ell' is a substring of 'hello'.
    
    cycpattern_check("whassup","psus") => False
    The rotations of 'psus' are 'susp', 'usps', and 'psus'. None of these are substrings of 'whassup'.
    
    cycpattern_check("abab","baa") => True
    The rotations of 'baa' are 'aab' and 'aba'. 'aba' is a substring of 'abab'.
    
    cycpattern_check("efef","eeff") => False
    The rotations of 'eeff' are 'feef', 'effe', and 'ffee'. None of these are substrings of 'efef'.
    
    cycpattern_check("himenss","simen") => True
    The rotations of 'simen' are 'imens', 'mensi', 'ensim', and 'nsime'. 'imens' is a substring of 'himenss'.
