def move_one_ball(arr):
    """
    The function 'move_one_ball' takes a list of unique integers 'arr' as an input. This could potentially be an empty list,
    or a list with 'N' integers in no particular order, represented as arr[1], arr[2], ..., arr[N]. The function's goal 
    is to check whether it is possible to sort this list in non-decreasing order by performing a specific operation - 
    a right shift operation - any number of times.

    The right shift operation works as follows: each element of the list is moved one position to the right, with the 
    element originally at the end of the list being moved to the start of the list, specifically the 0th index.

    If by applying this operation any number of times, the list can be sorted in a non-decreasing order, the function 
    will return True. If this is not possible, the function will return False. Additionally, if the provided list is 
    empty, the function will also return True, since an empty list is trivially sorted.

    Please note that all integers in the given list are guaranteed to be unique. Further note that the function is not 
    required to actually perform the sorting operation or the right shift operations, it only needs to determine if 
    such a sorting could theoretically be achieved.

    Examples:

    move_one_ball([3, 4, 5, 1, 2])==>True
    Explanation: The function returns True because, by performing two right shift operations, the list can be sorted 
    into a non-decreasing order.

    move_one_ball([3, 5, 4, 1, 2])==>False
    Explanation: The function returns False because, regardless of the number of right shift operations performed, 
    it is not possible to sort the list into a non-decreasing order.
