def encrypt(s):
    """
    Constructs a function named 'encrypt' that accepts a single parameter 's', which is a string.

    The purpose of this function is to implement a simple encryption mechanism, where the characters 
    of the English alphabet within the input string are shifted towards the end of the alphabet. The 
    shift moves each character two places further down after doubling, effectively making it a shift of 
    four places.

    The result is a new string with the same length as the input string, where each character from the 
    input string is replaced by the character that is found four places further in the alphabet.

    The function returns the encrypted string.

    Here are a few examples to illustrate the behavior of this function:

    - Calling encrypt('hi') will return 'lm', as 'h' is replaced by 'l' and 'i' is replaced by 'm'.
    - Calling encrypt('asdfghjkl') will return 'ewhjklnop', with each character in 'asdfghjkl' being 
      replaced by the one four places ahead in the alphabet.
    - Calling encrypt('gf') will return 'kj', with 'g' being replaced by 'k' and 'f' being replaced by 'j'.
    - Calling encrypt('et') will return 'ix', with 'e' being replaced by 'i' and 't' being replaced by 'x'.
