The first parameter, 'lst', is your two-dimensional data structure (the list of lists). The second parameter, 'x', is an integer. The function's job is to find all occurrences of this integer 'x' within the list of lists, and return their coordinates.\n\n    A coordinate is represented as a tuple, with the first element being the row index, and the second element being the column index. The indexing starts from 0, meaning that the first row and the first column are represented as 0. Therefore, a coordinate of (1, 2) refers to the second row, third column.\n\n    The function will return a list of such coordinates, with one tuple for each occurrence of the integer 'x' in the list of lists. If 'x' is not found in the list of lists, the function will return an empty list.\n\n    The function also puts some effort into sorting the returned coordinates. First, it sorts the coordinates by the row index in ascending order. This means that coordinates for smaller rows (i.e., those further to the top) appear before larger rows (those further to the bottom).

Here, the order is determined by subtracting the unicode value of 'a' from the unicode value of the letter, thus 'a' has an order of 0, 'b' has an order of 1 and so on till 'z' which has an order of 25.\n\n    The aim of the function is to return a list of words in the given string, split based on specific separators (whitespaces or commas). If no such separators are present, the function returns a count of lowercase letters with an odd order.\n\n    Examples:\n    - If the function is called with the string \"Hello world!\" like so: split_words(\"Hello world!\"), the function would return [\"Hello\", \"world!\"]\n\n    - If the function is called with the string \"Hello,world!\" like so: split_words(\"Hello,world!\"), the function would return [\"Hello\", \"world!\"]\n\n    - If the function is called with the string \"abcdef\" like so: split_words(\"abcdef\"), the function would return 3 as 'b', 'd' and 'f' are the lowercase letters with an odd order in the alphabet.\n    \"\"\"\n    if ' ' in txt:\n        return txt.split()\n    elif ',' in txt:\n        return txt.split(',')\n    else:\n        return sum((1 for c in txt if c.islower() and (ord(c) - ord('a')) % 2 != 0))", "base_status": "pass", "plus_status": "pass", "base_fail_tests": [], "plus_fail_tests": []}], "HumanEval/86": [{"task_id": "HumanEval/86", "solution": "\ndef anti_shuffle(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function, named 'anti_shuffle', accepts a string as its input and produces a new string as the output, \n    where each word in the input string is replaced by a new word that is ordered based on the ascii values of its characters. \n    The order of the characters is ascending, i.e., the characters with lower ascii values appear before the characters \n    with higher ascii values. \n\n    The function maintains the original order of the words and the blank spaces in the sentence. \n    In other words, the function does not rearrange the words or the blank spaces; it only rearranges the characters within each word.\n\n    For instance, if the input string is 'Hi', the function returns 'Hi' since the characters are already in ascending order based on ascii values.\n    If the input string is 'hello', the function returns 'ehllo' when it arranges the characters in ascending order.\n    If the input string is 'Hello World!!!', the function returns 'Hello !!!Wdlor'.

The first input, 's', is a string that represents the total number of oranges and apples in the basket. The format of this string should be a combination of two integers and two fruit names (apples and oranges) such as \"5 apples and 6 oranges\".\n\n    The second input, 'n', is an integer that represents the total number of fruits in the basket.

It's a straightforward program that hinges on a decision based on whether the number 'n' is a prime number or not.\n    \n    The first parameter, 'n', is an integer that the function will evaluate to determine if it's a prime number. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. \n    \n    The second and third parameters, 'x' and 'y', are also integers. These parameters act as return values based on the primality of the first parameter 'n'. \n    \n    If 'n' is determined to be a prime number, the function will return the value of 'x'. If 'n' is not a prime number, the function will return the value of 'y'.\n    \n    Therefore, in essence, this function uses a simple test of primality to decide which of two given numbers to return.\n\n    Examples:\n    Consider the function call x_or_y(7, 34, 12). Here, since 7 is a prime number, the function will return 34.\n    \n    Now consider the function call x_or_y(15, 8, 5).

The function counts \n    the number of consonants in each word and if the count equals 'n', the word is added to the output list.\n\n    If the input string 's' is empty (i.e., it doesn't contain any characters or it only contains white spaces), \n    then the function should return an empty list.\n\n    The function makes the assumption that the input string only contains alphabetic characters and spaces, it doesn't account \n    for any other special characters, numbers or punctuation.\n\n    Examples:\n    select_words(\"Mary had a little lamb\", 4) ==> [\"little\"]\n    select_words(\"Mary had a little lamb\", 3) ==> [\"Mary\", \"lamb\"]\n    select_words(\"simple white space\", 2) ==> []\n    select_words(\"Hello world\", 4) ==> [\"world\"]\n    select_words(\"Uncle sam\", 3) ==> [\"Uncle\"]\n\n    In the first example, the word \"little\" is the only word that contains exactly 4 consonants, hence it's the only \n    word in the output list.
