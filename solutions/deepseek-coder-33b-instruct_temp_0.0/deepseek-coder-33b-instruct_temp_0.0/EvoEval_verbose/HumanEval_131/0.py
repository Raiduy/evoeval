def digits(n):
    """
    This function, digits, takes a single input, n, which should be a positive integer. The purpose of this function is to calculate 
    and return the total product of all the odd digits that appear in n. It does this by first identifying all the odd digits in the integer,
    and then multiplying them together to calculate their product. 

    Here, an 'odd' digit is defined as any integer that is not evenly divisible by 2. For instance, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 are all considered odd digits.

    If the input integer n consists only of 'even' digits, which are digits that are evenly divisible by 2 (e.g., 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8), then the function returns 0. 
    This is because there are no odd digits in n to multiply together.

    Let's consider a few examples to demonstrate how this function works:

    If we input the integer 1 into the function, like so: digits(1), then the function will return 1. This is because 1 is the only digit in the 
    integer, and since 1 is an odd digit, the product of the odd digits is 1. 

    If we input 4 into the function, like so: digits(4), then the function will return 0. This is because 4 is the only digit in the integer, 
    but since 4 is an even digit, there are no odd digits to multiply together, and so the function returns 0. 

    If we input the integer 235 into the function, like so: digits(235), then the function will return 15. This is because 235 contains three digits: 
    2, 3, and 5. The odd digits in 235 are 3 and 5, and when we multiply these two digits together, we get 15. Therefore, the function returns 15.
