def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    """
    This function evaluates a string consisting only of '<' and '>' characters, referred to as 'brackets'.
    
    The aim is to determine if every opening bracket '<' has a corresponding closing bracket '>'. The function
    assumes that a correct bracketing implies that for each opening bracket, there must exist a closing bracket 
    that is not already paired with a different opening bracket. This follows the typical rules of bracketing in 
    programming or mathematics.
    
    The function takes a single argument:
    1. brackets: a string composed only of '<' and '>' characters. The string represents the sequence of opening and 
    closing brackets that need to be evaluated.
    
    The function returns a boolean value:
    - If every opening bracket in the string has a corresponding closing bracket, the function returns True.
    - If there exists at least one opening bracket without a corresponding closing bracket, the function returns False.
    
    Examples:
    >>> correct_bracketing("<")
    False
    - In this case, there is one opening bracket but no corresponding closing bracket, hence the function returns False.
    
    >>> correct_bracketing("<>")
    True
    - In this case, there is one opening bracket and one corresponding closing bracket, hence the function returns True.
    
    >>> correct_bracketing("<<><>>")
    True
    - In this case, there are three opening brackets and three corresponding closing brackets, hence the function returns True.
    
    >>> correct_bracketing("><<>")
    False
    - In this case, the first closing bracket doesn't have a corresponding opening bracket before it. Therefore, it returns False.
