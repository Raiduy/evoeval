def generate_integers(a, b):
    """
    This function, `generate_integers`, takes two positive integer arguments, `a` and `b`. It's goal is to generate 
    a list of all the even integers that are situated within the range of these two integers, inclusive. The order of 
    the integers in the returned list should be ascending, regardless of the relative values of `a` and `b`.
    
    The function does not differentiate between cases where `a` is larger or smaller than `b` - it always returns 
    the results in an ascending order. If there are no even numbers in the range, the function returns an empty list.
    The function only considers whole, even numbers - therefore, if the range is within a number and the next 
    decimal (eg. 2, 2.8), it will not return any additional values (eg. 2.2, 2.4, 2.6).
    
    This function is particularly useful for generating sequences of numbers in numerical analysis, where even numbers 
    are often used for various computations.
    
    Here are a few examples of how this function can be used:
    
    Example 1:
    If we call `generate_integers(2, 8)`, the function will return the list `[2, 4, 6, 8]`. In this case, both 
    `a` and `b` are even, so they are included in the returned list.
    
    Example 2:
    A call to `generate_integers(8, 2)` will also return the list `[2, 4, 6, 8]`. Even though `a` is larger than `b`, 
    the function will still return the numbers in ascending order.
    
    Example 3:
    If we call `generate_integers(10, 14)`, the function will return an empty list `[]`. Here, although `a` and `b` 
    are themselves even numbers, there are no additional even numbers within the range they define. Therefore, the 
    function returns an empty list.

        (a, b) = (b, a)
    return [i for i in range(a, b + 1) if i % 2 == 0]
