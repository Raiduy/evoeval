def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):
    """
    The purpose of this function is to determine whether or not the last character of a provided string is an alphabetical character, 
    while also making sure that this character does not belong to a group of characters that constitutes a word (a word being defined as 
    a sequence of characters separated by space). 

    This function receives one argument:
    - txt (str): The input string that the function will check.

    The function will return True if the last character of the string text is an alphabetical character that stands alone, i.e., that does 
    not belong to a word, and will return False in any other scenario, including when the string is empty or ends with a space.

    Examples:
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pie") => False
    Explanation: The string ends with a word, "pie".

    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e") => True
    Explanation: The string ends with a standalone alphabetical character, "e".
    
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e ") => False
    Explanation: The string ends with a space, hence no standalone alphabetical character at the end.

    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("") => False
    Explanation: The string is empty, hence there's no character to check.
