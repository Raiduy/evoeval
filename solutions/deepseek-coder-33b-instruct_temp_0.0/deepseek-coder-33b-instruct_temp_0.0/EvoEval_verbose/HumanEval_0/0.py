def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """
    This function takes in two parameters, a list of floating point numbers and a floating point threshold.
    It checks whether there exist any two numbers in the provided list that have a difference smaller than the given threshold.
    In other words, it determines if there are any two numbers in the list that are closer to each other than the specified threshold.

    The function returns a boolean value. If there are such close elements in the list, it returns True, otherwise it returns False.

    Parameters:
    numbers (List[float]): The list of floating point numbers to check. 
    threshold (float): The threshold for determining closeness. This is a positive floating point number.

    Returns:
    bool: True if there are any two numbers in the list that are closer to each other than the given threshold, otherwise False.

    Examples:
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
    False
    The function returns False since all pairs of numbers in the list have a difference greater than 0.5.

    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
    True
    The function returns True since the pair of numbers (2.8, 3.0) in the list have a difference smaller than 0.3.
