def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    """
    This function, string_sequence, takes an integer 'n' as an input and returns a string.
    
    The function generates a sequence of integers within the range of 0 to n (inclusive of both). 
    The sequence is then converted to a string format with each number separated by a space.
    
    The purpose of this function is to create a string representation of a sequence of numbers, 
    which could be useful in a variety of applications where such formatted numerical data is required.
    
    Parameters:
    n (int): A non-negative integer that defines the upper limit of the sequence. 
    
    Returns:
    str: A string representing a sequence of space-separated numbers from 0 to n inclusive.
    
    Examples:
    If the function is called with an argument of 0, it will return a string '0'. 
    >>> string_sequence(0)
    '0'
    
    If the function is called with an argument of 5, it will return a string '0 1 2 3 4 5'. 
    >>> string_sequence(5)
    '0 1 2 3 4 5'
