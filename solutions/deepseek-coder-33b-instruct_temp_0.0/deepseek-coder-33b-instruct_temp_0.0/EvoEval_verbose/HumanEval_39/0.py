def prime_fib(n: int):
    """
    The function prime_fib calculates the nth number that is both a Fibonacci number and a prime number. 

    A Fibonacci number is a number in the Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

    The function takes an integer n as an argument, and returns the nth number that satisfies the above conditions. If n is not a valid input (e.g. a negative number, zero, or a non-integer), the function's behavior is undefined.

    The function uses an efficient algorithm that is capable of calculating large Fibonacci primes in a reasonable amount of time.

    Here are some examples of how this function can be used:

    >>> prime_fib(1)
    2
    This returns 2 because 2 is the 1st number that is both a Fibonacci number and a prime number.

    >>> prime_fib(2)
    3
    This returns 3 because 3 is the 2nd number that is both a Fibonacci number and a prime number.

    >>> prime_fib(3)
    5
    This returns 5 because 5 is the 3rd number that is both a Fibonacci number and a prime number.

    >>> prime_fib(4)
    13
    This returns 13 because 13 is the 4th number that is both a Fibonacci number and a prime number.

    >>> prime_fib(5)
    89
    This returns 89 because 89 is the 5th number that is both a Fibonacci number and a prime number.
