def maximum(arr, k):
    """
    This function, 'maximum', is designed to take two parameters: 'arr', an array consisting of integers, and 'k', a positive integer. The role of this function is to return a sorted list of 'k' length, which includes the maximum 'k' numbers from the array 'arr'.

    Detailed input specifications are as follows:

    'arr': This is an array that comprises of integers. The length of this array can be expected to fall within the range [1, 1000]. Each element within this array will be an integer that falls within the range [-1000, 1000].

    'k': This is a positive integer that represents the length of the sorted list to be returned. It is also the count of maximum numbers to be picked from 'arr'. The value of 'k' will be such that 0 <= k <= len(arr).

    Now, let's consider a few examples to illustrate the function's operation:

    Example 1:

        If the Input is: arr = [-3, -4, 5], k = 3
        The Output will be: [-4, -3, 5]

        Explanation: Here, 'k' equals the length of the array 'arr'. Hence, all numbers are included in the output but sorted in ascending order.

    Example 2:

        If the Input is: arr = [4, -4, 4], k = 2
        The Output will be: [4, 4]

        Explanation: The 'k' maximum numbers in the array 'arr' are [4,4]. Hence, that's our output.

    Example 3:

        If the Input is: arr = [-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1], k = 1
        The Output will be: [2]

        Explanation: The maximum number in the array 'arr' is 2. Since 'k' equals 1, only the maximum number is included in the output.
