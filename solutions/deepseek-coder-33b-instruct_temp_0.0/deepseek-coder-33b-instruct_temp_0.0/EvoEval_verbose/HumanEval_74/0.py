def total_match(lst1, lst2):
    """
    This function, named 'total_match', takes two inputs: 'lst1' and 'lst2'. Both inputs should be lists consisting of string elements.

    The function's objective is to compare the total count of characters in all strings within each list and returns the list that has a smaller total count of characters. If both lists have an equal total count of characters, the function will return the first list ('lst1').

    Each string in the list is considered a sequence of characters, and as such, the function will count the number of characters in each string and sum them up for each list. After which, these totals are compared and the list with the fewer characters is returned.

    Here are some examples to illustrate the function's behavior:

    For an input of empty lists, like total_match([], []), the function will return an empty list: []

    For inputs like total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'Hi']), where the total count of characters in 'lst1' is 7 and in 'lst2' it is 4, the function will return ['hI', 'Hi'].

    For inputs like total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hi', 'hi', 'admin', 'project']), where the total count of characters in 'lst1' is 7 and in 'lst2' it is 16, the function will return ['hi', 'admin'].

    For inputs like total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'hi', 'hi']), where the total count of characters in 'lst1' is 7 and in 'lst2' it is 6, the function will return ['hI', 'hi', 'hi'].

    For inputs like total_match(['4'], ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']), where the total count of characters in 'lst1' is 1 and in 'lst2' it is 5, the function will return ['4'].
