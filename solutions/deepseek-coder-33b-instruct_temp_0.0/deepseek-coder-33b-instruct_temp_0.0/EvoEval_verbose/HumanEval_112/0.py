def reverse_delete(s, c):
    """
    This function, 'reverse_delete', takes two input parameters: 's' and 'c'. Both are strings. 
    The function's purpose is to process 's' by removing all instances of each individual character 
    found in 'c' from 's'. 

    After the deletion operation, the function then determines whether the resulting string is a palindrome. 
    A string is identified as a palindrome if it reads identical from left to right as it does from right to left,
    i.e., it exhibits symmetry around its center.

    The function returns a tuple. The first element of the tuple is the resulting string after the deletion.
    The second element of the tuple is a boolean value indicating whether or not the resulting string is a palindrome. 

    Parameters:
    s (str): The original string that needs to be processed.
    c (str): The characters in this string are to be deleted from the original string 's'.

    Returns:
    tuple: Contains the processed string and a boolean value indicating if the processed string is a palindrome.

    Examples:

    If 's' = "abcde" and 'c' = "ae", the function should return ('bcd', False) - 
    because after deleting 'a' and 'e' from 's', the resulting string is 'bcd', 
    which is not a palindrome (thus, False).

    If 's' = "abcdef" and 'c' = "b" the function should return ('acdef', False) - 
    because after deleting 'b' from 's', the resulting string is 'acdef', 
    which is not a palindrome (thus, False).

    If 's' = "abcdedcba" and 'c' = "ab", the function should return ('cdedc', True) - 
    because after deleting 'a' and 'b' from 's', the resulting string is 'cdedc', 
    which is a palindrome (thus, True).
