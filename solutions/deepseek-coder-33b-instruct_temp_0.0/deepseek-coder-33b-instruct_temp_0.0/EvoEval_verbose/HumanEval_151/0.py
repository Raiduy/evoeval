def double_the_difference(lst):
    """
    This function handles an input list of numbers and operates on the values that are positive odd integers, 
    while it completely ignores negative numbers and non-integer values. The function squares each of these selected 
    odd integers and then sums up the results. 

    The function takes one parameter:
    lst: A list of numbers. This could include integers and non-integers, positive or negative values, or 
    even be an empty list.

    The function returns a single integer, which represents the collective sum of squares of the odd 
    integer values in the list. If there are no positive odd integers in the list, the function will return 0. 
    Similarly, if the input list is empty, the function will also return 0.

    Examples:
    >>> double_the_difference([1, 3, 2, 0])
    10
    Explanation: The odd numbers in the list are 1 and 3. Their squares are 1 and 9 respectively, and 
    the sum is 1 + 9 = 10.

    >>> double_the_difference([-1, -2, 0])
    0
    Explanation: There are no positive odd numbers in the list. Therefore, the function returns 0.

    >>> double_the_difference([9, -2])
    81
    Explanation: The only positive odd number in the list is 9. Its square is 81, so the function returns 81.

    >>> double_the_difference([0])
    0
    Explanation: There are no positive odd numbers in the list. Therefore, the function returns 0.
