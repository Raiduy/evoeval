def valid_date(date):
    """
    This function checks the validity of a given date string based on specific rules and returns a Boolean value. If the date string satisfies all the rules, it returns True, otherwise it returns False.

    To be considered valid, the input date string has to fulfill all the following conditions:
    1. The date string should not be empty. If the input string does not contain any characters, the function will return False.
    2. The day of the month in the date string should not be less than 1 or more than 31 for the following months: January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12). For the months April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11), the day of the month should not be less than 1 or more than 30. For February (2), the day of the month should not be less than 1 or more than 29.
    3. The month in the date string should not be less than 1 or more than 12. If it falls outside this range, the function will return False.
    4. The date string should be in the format: mm-dd-yyyy. Any other formats will be considered invalid and the function will return False.

    Here are several examples to illustrate the functionality of this function:

    valid_date('03-11-2000') should return True, as '03-11-2000' is a valid date string.

    valid_date('15-01-2012') should return False, as '15-01-2012' is not a valid date string because it uses the day-month-year format.

    valid_date('04-0-2040') should return False, as '04-0-2040' is not a valid date string because the day of the month is 0.

    valid_date('06-04-2020') should return True, as '06-04-2020' is a valid date string.

    valid_date('06/04/2020') should return False, as '06/04/2020' is not a valid date string because it uses slashes instead of dashes to separate the month, day, and year.
