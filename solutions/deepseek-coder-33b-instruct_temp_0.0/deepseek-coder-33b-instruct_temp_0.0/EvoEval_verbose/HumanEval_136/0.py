def largest_smallest_integers(lst):
    """
    This function is designed to find and return the largest negative integer and the smallest positive integer within a list of numbers. 
    The function takes a list of integers as an input and returns a tuple of two values (a, b).
    
    'a' corresponds to the largest negative integer from the list. This implies that if the list contains multiple negative numbers, 
    the function would return the one closest to zero. If there are no negative integers in the list, 'a' should be returned as None.
    
    'b' is the smallest positive integer from the list. In other words, it is the positive number furthest from zero that is present 
    in the list. If there are no positive integers in the list, 'b' should be returned as None.
    
    If the list contains no elements, the function should return (None, None) indicating that there are neither positive nor negative integers.
    
    Zero is neither considered negative nor positive, so if the list consists of [0] or similar elements, the function would return (None, None).
    
    Examples:
    largest_smallest_integers([2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7]) should return (None, 1) as there are no negative integers and the smallest positive integer is 1.
    largest_smallest_integers([]) should return (None, None) because the list contains no elements.
    largest_smallest_integers([0]) should return (None, None) because zero is neither negative nor positive.
