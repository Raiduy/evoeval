def string_to_md5(text):
    """
    Given a string 'text', this function will return its MD5 hash equivalent as a string. 

    The MD5 hashing algorithm is a widely used cryptographic hash function that produces a 128-bit (16-byte) hash value. It is commonly used to verify data integrity. MD5 has been utilized in a wide variety of security applications and is also commonly used to check the integrity of files. However, MD5 is not collision-resistant; as of 2019, a good hardware and the SHAttered attack can find a new collision in a few days and as such is not suitable for functions such as SSL certificates or encryption that rely on a large number of unique keys.

    This function uses the standard Python library's hashlib.md5() function to perform the hash operation. The hashlib module, included in The Python Standard Library, is a module containing an interface to many different secure hash and message digest algorithms. Included are the FIPS secure hash algorithms SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512 (defined in FIPS 180-2) as well as RSA's MD5 algorithm. 

    If 'text' is an empty string, the function will return None. An empty string is a string with no characters. In Python, an empty string can be created with just two quotes `''` or `""`. 

    The function takes one argument:
    1. text (str): The input string that needs to be hashed using the MD5 algorithm. 

    This function returns a string: the MD5 hash of the input string 'text'. If 'text' is an empty string, the function returns None.

    Example:

    >>> string_to_md5('Hello world') 
    '3e25960a79dbc69b674cd4ec67a72c62'
    """
    if text == '':
        return None
    else:
        result = hashlib.md5(text.encode())
        return result.hexdigest()
