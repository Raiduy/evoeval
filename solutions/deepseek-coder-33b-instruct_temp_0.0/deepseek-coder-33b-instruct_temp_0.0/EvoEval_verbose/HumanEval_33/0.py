def sort_third(l: list):
    """
    This function takes as input, a list 'l'. The function returns a new list 'l_prime' such that:
    
    - 'l_prime' is identical to 'l' for indices that are not divisible by three. This means that, for any index 'i' in 'l' such that 'i' is not divisible by three, the ith element in 'l' and 'l_prime' are the same.
    
    - For indices 'i' that are divisible by three, 'l_prime' at index 'i' equals the value of 'l' at index 'i', but in a sorted order. This means that the elements of 'l' that are located at indices divisible by three are sorted in 'l_prime', while preserving their indices.
    
    This function assumes that both 'l' and 'l_prime' are zero-indexed, i.e., the first element of the list is at index 0.
    
    The function does not mutate the original list 'l', it generates and returns a new list 'l_prime'.
    
    Let's consider a few examples to better understand the function's behavior:
    
    If we input the list [1, 2, 3] into the function, it will return the same list [1, 2, 3] because only the first element of the list is at an index divisible by three (index 0). Since there's only one such element, sorting it doesn't change the list.
    
    If we input the list [5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2] into the function, it will return the list [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]. Here, the elements at indices divisible by three are 5 (at index 0), 4 (at index 3) and 2 (at index 6). Sorting these elements gives us the sequence 2, 4, 5. Therefore, in the returned list, the elements at indices 0, 3 and 6 are 2, 4 and 5, respectively. All other elements remain the same as in the original list.
