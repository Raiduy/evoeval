def find_max(words):
    """
    This function is defined to solve a problem related to string manipulation. The function 'find_max' takes 
    a single argument, 'words'. The argument 'words' is expected to be a list of strings. Each string in the 
    list represents a word. 

    The function's purpose is to return a string from the list that contains the highest number of unique 
    characters compared to the other strings in the list. In other words, among all strings in the given list, 
    the function identifies the one that has the maximum variety of characters, and returns that string.

    However, it might happen that there are multiple strings in the list that have the same maximum number of 
    unique characters. In such cases, the function uses lexicographical order as a tie-breaker. Lexicographical 
    order, also known as dictionary order or alphabetical order, compares strings based on the alphabetical 
    order of their component characters. The function will return the string which would come first in the dictionary 
    if all the strings with maximum number of unique characters were listed in dictionary order.

    For instance, if the function is called with the argument ["name", "of", "string"], it will return "string" 
    because "string" has the maximum number of unique characters (6). 

    As another example, if the function is called with the argument ["name", "enam", "game"], it will return "enam" 
    because "enam" and "game" both have 4 unique characters, but "enam" comes first in lexicographical order. 

    Yet in another scenario, if the function is called with the argument ["aaaaaaa", "bb" ,"cc"], it will return 
    "aaaaaaa" because all the strings contain only one unique character but "aaaaaaa" comes first in 
    lexicographical order.
