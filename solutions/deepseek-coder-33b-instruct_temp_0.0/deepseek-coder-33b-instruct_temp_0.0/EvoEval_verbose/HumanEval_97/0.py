def multiply(a, b):
    """
    This function is designed to calculate the multiplication of the last digits, also known as the unit digits, of two inputted integers. This function accepts two arguments, both of which should be integers. The function will extract the unit digit from each integer, and then multiply these two unit digits together. The result of this multiplication is what the function will return.

    The function always expects valid inputs. It's important to note that for negative numbers, the function will still take the unit digit of the absolute value of the number. 

    Here are a few examples of how this function operates:

    If we call multiply(148, 412), the function first extracts the last digit from each number. For 148, this digit is 8. For 412, this digit is 2. The function then multiplies these two digits together and returns the result, 16.

    If we call multiply(19, 28), the function extracts the last digit from each number (9 and 8, respectively). It then multiplies these two digits together, yielding 72, which is returned.

    If we call multiply(2020, 1851), the function extracts the last digit from each number (0 and 1, respectively). The multiplication of these two digits is 0, which the function returns.

    If we call multiply(14, -15), the function will take the unit digit of the absolute value of -15, which is 5. Then, it multiplies 4 (the unit digit of 14) and 5, and returns 20.
