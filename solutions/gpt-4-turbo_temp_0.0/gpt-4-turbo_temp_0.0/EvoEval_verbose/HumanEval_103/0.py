def rounded_avg(n, m):
    """
    This function named 'rounded_avg' accepts two positive integer arguments, 'n' and 'm'. The purpose of this function 
    is to calculate and return the average of all integers in the range from 'n' to 'm', inclusive of 'n' and 'm' themselves. 

    The average is calculated in standard mathematical terms, as the sum of all numbers in the range divided by the count 
    of numbers in the range. Subsequently, the result of this calculation is then rounded to the closest integer value. 
    This nearest integer is then converted to binary form and returned as a string prefixed with '0b'.

    If the function encounters a scenario where 'n' is a larger value than 'm' (which means the range is invalid), the function 
    will return an integer value of -1 to signify an error in the input.

    Examples:
    1) For a function call of rounded_avg(1, 5), the function would calculate the average of [1,2,3,4,5], round the result 
    to the nearest integer and return its binary equivalent. Thus the result here would be "0b11".
    2) For a function call of rounded_avg(7, 5), since 'n' is greater than 'm' thus making the range invalid, the function 
    will return an error value of -1.
    3) For a function call of rounded_avg(10, 20), the function would calculate the average of all integers from 10 through 20. 
    The nearest integer to this average is 15, and its binary equivalent is "0b1111". Thus, the function would return "0b1111".
    4) For a function call of rounded_avg(20, 33), after calculating the average of all integers from 20 to 33 and rounding to 
    the nearest integer, the function would return its binary equivalent string "0b11010".
