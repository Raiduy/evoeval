Each element in the\n    list corresponds to the coefficient of a polynomial term. The index of the coefficient in the list \n    determines the power of the term it is associated with. \n\n    In other words, the polynomial is represented as follows: xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + ....\n    \n    The function will return a list of coefficients that represents the derivative of this polynomial. The \n    derivative is represented in the same form as the input polynomial. \n\n    Here are a couple of examples to illustrate the functionality of this function.\n\n    If the input is [3, 1, 2, 4, 5], the function will return [1, 4, 12, 20]. This is because the original \n    polynomial is 3 + x + 2x^2 + 4x^3 + 5x^4, and its derivative is 1 + 4x + 12x^2 + 20x^3\n\n    If the input is [1, 2, 3], the function will return [2, 6]. This is because the original polynomial is \n    1 + 2x + 3x^2, and its derivative is 2 + 6x.\n\n    Args:\n    xs: A list of numbers representing the coefficients of a polynomial.\n\n    Returns:\n    A list of numbers representing the coefficients of the derivative of the input polynomial.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(xs) <= 1:\n        return []\n    derivative_coeffs = [i * xs[i] for i in range(1, len(xs))]\n    return derivative_coeffs", "base_status": "pass", "plus_status": "pass", "base_fail_tests": [], "plus_fail_tests": []}], "HumanEval/112": [{"task_id": "HumanEval/112", "solution": "\ndef reverse_delete(s, c):\n    for char in c:\n        s = s.replace(char, '')\n    is_palindrome = s == s[::-1]\n    return (s, is_palindrome)", "base_status": "pass", "plus_status": "pass", "base_fail_tests": [], "plus_fail_tests": []}], "HumanEval/131": [{"task_id": "HumanEval/131", "solution": "\ndef digits(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and returns the total product of all the odd digits in the input integer n.\n    \"\"\"\n    n_str = str(n)\n    product = 1\n    has_odd = False\n    for char in n_str:\n        digit = int(char)\n        if digit % 2 != 0:\n            product *= digit\n            has_odd = True\n    if not has_odd:\n        return 0\n    else:\n        return product", "base_status": "pass", "plus_status": "pass", "base_fail_tests": [], "plus_fail_tests": []}], "HumanEval/128": [{"task_id": "HumanEval/128", "solution": "\ndef prod_signs(arr):\n    if not arr:\n        return None\n    sum_abs = 0\n    sign_product = 1\n    for num in arr:\n        sum_abs += abs(num)\n        if num == 0:\n            sign_product = 0\n            break\n        elif num < 0:\n            sign_product *= -1\n    return sum_abs * sign_product", "base_status": "pass", "plus_status": "pass", "base_fail_tests": [], "plus_fail_tests": []}], "HumanEval/115": [{"task_id": "HumanEval/115", "solution": "\ndef max_fill(grid, capacity):\n    import math\n    total_water = sum((sum(row) for row in grid))\n    total_lowerings = math.ceil(total_water / capacity)\n    return total_lowerings", "base_status": "fail", "plus_status": "fail", "base_fail_tests": [[[[1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1]], 9]], "plus_fail_tests": [[[[1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1]], 2]]}], "HumanEval/57": [{"task_id": "HumanEval/57", "solution": "\n\ndef monotonic(l: list) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes in a list of integers or floats as its input and checks whether the elements in the list are \n    monotonically increasing or decreasing. \n\n    Monotonically increasing means that each subsequent element in the list is greater than or equal to the previous one, \n    while monotonically decreasing means that each subsequent element in the list is less than or equal to the previous one. \n\n    If the list is either monotonically increasing or decreasing, the function will return a boolean value of True. \n    If the list is not monotonically increasing or decreasing, the function will return a boolean value of False.\n\n    Args:\n    l (list): A list of numbers (integers or floats)\n\n    Returns:\n    bool: True if the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing, False otherwise\n\n    Examples:\n    >>> monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20])\n    True\n    This example returns True because the list is monotonically increasing.\n\n    >>> monotonic([1, 20, 4, 10])\n    False\n    This example returns False because the list is not monotonically increasing nor decreasing.\n\n    >>> monotonic([4, 1, 0, -10])\n    True\n    This example returns True because the list is monotonically decreasing.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not l:\n        return True\n    increasing = decreasing = True\n    for i in range(1, len(l)):\n        if l[i] > l[i - 1]:\n            decreasing = False\n        elif l[i] < l[i - 1]:\n            increasing = False\n    return increasing or decreasing", "base_status": "pass", "plus_status": "pass", "base_fail_tests": [], "plus_fail_tests": []}], "HumanEval/148": [{"task_id": "HumanEval/148", "solution": "\ndef bf(planet1, planet2):\n    planets = ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune']\n    if planet1 not in planets or planet2 not in planets:\n        return ()\n    index1 = planets.index(planet1)\n    index2 = planets.index(planet2)\n    if index1 > index2:\n        (index1, index2) = (index2, index1)\n    return tuple(planets[index1 + 1:index2])", "base_status": "pass", "plus_status": "pass", "base_fail_tests": [], "plus_fail_tests": []}], "HumanEval/65": [{"task_id": "HumanEval/65", "solution": "\ndef circular_shift(x, shift):\n    \"\"\"\n    Circularly shifts the digits of an integer around, moving them right by a specified number of places \n    and then returning the result as a string.\n\n    The function accepts two arguments - an integer 'x' and an integer 'shift'.

Each digit will either be '0' or '1', corresponding to the binary notation.\n\n    To assist with formatting, the returned binary string will be enclosed within an extra couple of characters 'db' both at the start and at the end of the string. These characters are not part of the binary representation of the number and are purely for formatting purposes.\n\n    For instance, if the input to the function is the decimal number 15, the binary representation for 15 is '1111', and the return of the function will be \"db1111db\".

The sequence begins with the number 3 (when n equals to 1), and the subsequent numbers in the sequence are defined as follows:\n\n    For an even number 'n', the nth element of the Tribonacci sequence, tri(n), is calculated as 1 plus n divided by 2.\n\n    For an odd number 'n', the nth element of the Tribonacci sequence, tri(n), is calculated as the sum of the previous number in the sequence (tri(n - 1)), the number two places before it (tri(n - 2)), and the number after it (tri(n + 1)).\n\n    As an example, tri(2), where n is even, would be calculated as 1 + (2 / 2) to give a result of 2. tri(4) would be calculated as 1 + (4 / 2) to give a result of 3. tri(3), where n is odd, would be calculated as the sum of tri(2), tri(1), and tri(4) to give a result of 8.\n\n    The

the returned element is greater than the minimum element of the 'lst' \n    but no other element in the list is smaller than this second smallest element.\n\n    If the list 'lst' is empty or all elements in 'lst' are the same, the function returns None. \n    This is because in such cases, there is no valid 'second smallest' element.\n\n    Below are some examples to illustrate how the function operates:\n\n    Example 1:\n    If the function is called as next_smallest([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), the function will return 2. \n    This is because 2 is the second smallest element in the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].\n\n    Example 2:\n    If the function is called as next_smallest([5, 1, 4, 3, 2]), the function will return 2.\n    Even though the elements are not in ascending order, 2 is still the second smallest element in the list.\n\n    Example 3:\n    If the function is called as next_smallest([]), the function will return None.\n    This is because the input list is empty and therefore there are no elements to consider.\n\n    Example 4:\n    If the function is called as next_smallest([1, 1]), the function will return None.\n    This is due to the fact that all elements in the list are the same, so there is no 'second smallest' element.\n\n    Note: The function assumes that all elements in the input list 'lst' are integers.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not lst or len(set(lst))
