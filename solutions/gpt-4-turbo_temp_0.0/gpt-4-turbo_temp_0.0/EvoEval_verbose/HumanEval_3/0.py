def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """
    This function takes a list of integers which represent deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account. 
    The bank account is assumed to start with a zero balance. The list of operations contains both positive and 
    negative integers, where positive integers represent deposits and negative integers represent withdrawals 
    from the account.

    The function's job is to check every operation and update the current balance accordingly. After each 
    operation, it checks whether the balance of the account has fallen below zero.

    If at any point during the execution of operations, the balance of the account falls below zero, the function 
    immediately returns True. This indicates that the account balance has been negatively impacted.

    If after executing all operations, the balance of the account never fell below zero, the function returns False. 
    This indicates that the account balance remained non-negative throughout the entire sequence of operations.
    
    Parameters:
    operations (List[int]): A list of integers where each integer represents a deposit (positive integer) or a 
    withdrawal (negative integer) operation.

    Returns:
    bool: True if at any point the balance of the account falls below zero. Otherwise, False.

    Examples:
    >>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
    False
    >>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
    True
