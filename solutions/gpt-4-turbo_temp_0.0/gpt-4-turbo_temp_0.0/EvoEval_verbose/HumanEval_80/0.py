def is_happy(s):
    """
    This function accepts a string, denoted as 's', as its parameter and aims to determine whether the input string is 'happy' or not. 

    For a string to be considered 'happy', it must meet the following criteria:
    1. The length of the string should be at least 3 characters.
    2. Every set of 3 consecutive letters in the string must be different from each other, i.e., no repetition of letters in any three-character sequence.

    For example, 

    If 's' equals to 'a', the function should return False because the string length is less than 3.
        is_happy('a') => False

    If 's' equals to 'aa', the function should return False because the string length is less than 3.
        is_happy('aa') => False

    If 's' equals to 'abcd', the function should return True because the string length is more than 3, and all sets of 3 consecutive letters are distinct.
        is_happy('abcd') => True

    If 's' equals to 'aabb', the function should return False because even though the string length is more than 3, there's a repetition of letters in the three-character sequence.
        is_happy('aabb') => False

    If 's' equals to 'adb', the function should return True because the string length is more than 3, and all sets of 3 consecutive letters are distinct.
        is_happy('adb') => True

    If 's' equals to 'xyy', the function should return False because even though the string length is more than 3, there's a repetition of letters in the three-character sequence.
        is_happy('xyy') => False
