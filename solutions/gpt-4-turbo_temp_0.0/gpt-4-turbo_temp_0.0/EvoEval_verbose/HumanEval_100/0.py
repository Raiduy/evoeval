def make_a_pile(n):
    """
    This function is designed to create a 'pile' based on a positive integer input, 'n'. The pile represents levels of stones.
    Each level's population of stones is determined by a specific rule based on whether the input integer is odd or even.

    The pile is constructed in the following way: 
    The first level always contains 'n' stones, where 'n' is the positive integer input.
    For subsequent levels, the number of stones is determined by the following rules:
        - If 'n' is an odd number, then the number of stones on the next level will be the next odd number after 'n' stones.
        - If 'n' is an even number, then the number of stones on the next level will be the next even number after 'n' stones.

    The function returns a list where each element represents the number of stones on that level. The index of each element in the list represents the level (i+1).
    For example, the first element in the list (index 0) represents the number of stones on the first level, the second element (index 1) represents the number of stones on the second level, and so on.

    Parameters:
    n (int): A positive integer which acts as the base for the pile of stones.

    Returns:
    List[int]: A list of integers where each element represents the number of stones on a certain level of the pile. The index of each element represents the level (i+1).
