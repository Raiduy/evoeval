def eat(number, need, remaining):
    """
    This function simulates a situation where you are a hungry rabbit. You have already consumed a certain quantity of 
    carrots denoted by the variable 'number'. However, you still require more carrots to meet the day's dietary needs. 
    The number of additional carrots you need is represented by the variable 'need'. The total stock of remaining carrots 
    available for consumption is represented by the variable 'remaining'.
    
    The function returns an array with two elements. The first element represents the total number of carrots you have 
    consumed after finishing your meal. This total is the sum of the number of carrots you had already eaten and the 
    number of additional carrots you needed to eat, provided there were enough remaining carrots. If the number of 
    remaining carrots was less than the number of additional carrots you needed to eat, you consume all the remaining 
    carrots, and this total will be less than the sum of 'number' and 'need'. 
    
    The second element in the array is the number of carrots left after you have completed your meal. This is calculated 
    by subtracting the number of carrots consumed from the total number of remaining carrots. If there were not enough 
    remaining carrots to meet your needs, this value will be zero, implying you have consumed all the available carrots.
    
    If there are not enough remaining carrots to satisfy your hunger, the function will still return the total number of
    carrots eaten and the remaining number of carrots (which will be zero), but it should be understood that you will 
    still be hungry.
    
    Here are some examples to demonstrate how the function operates:
    
    * eat(5, 6, 10) -> [11, 4]
    * eat(4, 8, 9) -> [12, 1]
    * eat(1, 10, 10) -> [11, 0]
    * eat(2, 11, 5) -> [7, 0]
    
    The function operates under the following constraints for its variables:
    
    @number : integer
        the number of carrots that you have eaten.
        This must be a non-negative integer not exceeding 1000.
        
    @need : integer
        the number of carrots that you need to eat.
        This must be a non-negative integer not exceeding 1000.
        
    @remaining : integer
        the number of remaining carrots that exist in stock
