def unique_digits(x):
    """
    This function, `unique_digits`, takes as its input a list of positive integers, `x`. 
    It processes this list to output a new list of integers that do not contain any even digit.

    The function iterates over all the integers in the input list and filters out those 
    integers that contain any even digit. The remaining integers are those that only 
    consist of odd digits.

    After filtering, the function sorts these remaining integers in increasing order 
    and returns this sorted list. 

    If there are no integers in the input list that meet the criteria, the function 
    returns an empty list.

    The returned list is sorted in ascending order.

    Parameters:
    x (list of int): A list of positive integers

    Returns:
    list of int: A sorted list of integers from the input that contain no even digits.

    Examples:
    >>> unique_digits([15, 33, 1422, 1])
    [1, 15, 33]
    
    In this example, the integers 15, 33, and 1 from the input list do not contain any even digits, 
    so they are included in the output list. The integer 1422 is not included in the output list 
    because it contains the even digits 2 and 4. The output list is sorted in increasing order.
    
    >>> unique_digits([152, 323, 1422, 10])
    []
    
    In this example, none of the integers from the input list meet the criteria of not containing 
    any even digits, so the output is an empty list.
