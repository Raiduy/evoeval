def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    """
    This function checks if the given integer 'n' can be expressed as the sum of exactly four positive even numbers. 

    An even number is defined as a number that is divisible by 2 with no remainder left. In this case, the function 'is_equal_to_sum_even' aims to find out if there are four such even numbers which, when added together, can give the final value equivalent to the input number 'n'. 

    If such a combination of four even numbers exists, the function returns 'True'. If not, the function returns 'False'.

    Parameters:
    n (int): The input number to be evaluated. It should be a positive integer.

    Returns:
    bool: 'True' if the input number 'n' can be written as the sum of exactly four positive even numbers, 'False' otherwise.

    Examples:
    is_equal_to_sum_even(4) should return False
    It is because there's no way to express 4 as the sum of exactly four positive even numbers.

    is_equal_to_sum_even(6) should return False
    It is because there's no way to express 6 as the sum of exactly four positive even numbers.

    is_equal_to_sum_even(8) should return True
    It is because 8 can be expressed as the sum of four positive even numbers: 2 + 2 + 2 + 2.
