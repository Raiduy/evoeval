def compare_one(a, b):
    """
    This function is designed to accept two parameters - 'a' and 'b' - which can be integers, floats, or
    strings representing real numbers and return the parameter that has the larger value, whilst preserving
    its original variable type. It's important to note that if the real number is expressed as a string,
    the decimal point can be represented either by a period (.) or a comma (,).

    If the two parameters are equal in value, regardless of their variable type, the function will return None.

    The function can handle a mix of different variable types in the parameters. For example, you can compare 
    an integer with a string representation of a real number. However, keep in mind that the returned value 
    will be in its original variable type.

    Examples:

    If 'a' is 1 and 'b' is 2.5 (a float), the function will return 2.5 since 2.5 is larger than 1.
    example: compare_one(1, 2.5) => 2.5

    If 'a' is 1 (an integer) and 'b' is "2,3" (a string representing a real number), the function will return "2,3"
    since 2.3 is larger than 1.
    example: compare_one(1, "2,3") => "2,3"

    If 'a' is "5,1" and 'b' is "6" (both are strings representing real numbers), the function will return "6"
    since 6 is larger than 5.1.
    example: compare_one("5,1", "6") => "6"

    If 'a' is "1" and 'b' is 1 (one is a string the other is an integer but both represent the same value),
    the function will return None since both values are equal.
    example: compare_one("1", 1) => None
