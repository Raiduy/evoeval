def incr_list(l: list):
    """
    This function takes as input a list of integers and returns a new list where each element is incremented by 1.

    The function works by iterating over each element in the input list and adding 1 to its value. The incremented values are then added to a new list, which is returned as output.

    Parameters:
    l (list): A list of integers. This list can have any length, including 0, and the integers can be any valid integers.

    Returns:
    list: A new list containing the incremented values of the input list. The length of the output list will be the same as the input list, and the elements will be in the same order.

    Example usage:

    >>> incr_list([1, 2, 3])
    [2, 3, 4]

    In this example, the input list is [1, 2, 3], and the output list is [2, 3, 4], 
    which is the result of adding 1 to each element in the input list.

    >>> incr_list([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])
    [6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]

    In this example, the input list is [5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123], and the output list is [6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124], 
    which is the result of adding 1 to each element in the input list.
