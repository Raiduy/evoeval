def unique(l: list):
    """
    This function is responsible for returning a sorted list of unique elements present in the input list. 

    It receives a list, 'l', as an input argument. This list can contain any number of elements and these elements may or may not be unique.

    The function iterates over the elements of the input list and identifies the unique elements. Once all the unique elements are identified, they are sorted in ascending order.

    The sorted list of unique elements is then returned as the output of the function.

    Here is an example to demonstrate the usage of the function:

    >>> unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])
    The function will return the following output:
    [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]

    As it can be observed in the above example, the function has removed all the duplicate values from the list (for example, 3 and 5 that were present multiple times) and returned a sorted list of the unique values.
    """
    unique_list = list(set(l))
    unique_list.sort()
    return unique_list
