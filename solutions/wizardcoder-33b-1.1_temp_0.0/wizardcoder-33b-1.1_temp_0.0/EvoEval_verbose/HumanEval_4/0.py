def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """
    Calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) for a provided list of numbers.

    The Mean Absolute Deviation is a measure of statistical dispersion. It is calculated as the average absolute difference 
    between each value in a dataset and the mean of the dataset.

    This function takes as input a list of floating point numbers, calculates the mean of these numbers, then finds the absolute 
    difference between each number in the list and the calculated mean. The average of these absolute differences is returned 
    as the Mean Absolute Deviation.

    The formula for Mean Absolute Deviation is: MAD = average | x - x_mean |

    Args:
        numbers (List[float]): A list of floating point numbers.

    Returns:
        float: The Mean Absolute Deviation of the numbers in the input list.

    Example:
        >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
        1.0

    Note that the Mean Absolute Deviation gives equal weight to all values in the input list, irrespective of their magnitude. 
    This makes it a robust measure of dispersion, resistant to outliers in the data.
